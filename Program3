Given the first 2 terms A and B of an Arithmetic Series, tell the Nth term of the series.

User Task:
Since this will be a functional problem, you don't have to take input. 
You just have to complete the function NthAP() that takes the integer A, B, and N as a parameter.

Output:-

Sample Input:
2 3 4

Sample Output:
5

Sample Input:
1 2 10

Sample output:
10



Logic:-

static int NthAP(int A, int B, int N){
       int d=B-A;
       int AP=A+((N-1)*d);
       return AP;
    }
